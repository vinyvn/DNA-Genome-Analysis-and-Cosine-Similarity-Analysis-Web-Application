# DNA-Genome-Analysis-and-Cosine-Similarity-Analysis-Web-Application
Welcome to our DNA Genome Analysis and Cosine Similarity Analysis web application! This application provides a range of tools and functionalities for the analysis of DNA sequences, including nucleotide frequency analysis, protein synthesis operations, and the generation of dot plots for comparing two DNA sequences. 
# Features
## DNA Sequence Analysis
- Upload DNA Sequences: Upload DNA sequences in FASTA format for analysis.
- Nucleotide Frequency Analysis: View the frequency of adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C) in the sequence.
-  You can customize the colors for each nucleotide.
- DNA Composition: Calculate the GC content (for heat stability) and AT content of the DNA sequence.
- Protein Synthesis Operations: Perform transcription, translation, and complement operations on the DNA sequence.
- Additionally, you can analyze the frequency of amino acids in the translated protein sequence.
- Plot Amino Acid Frequency: Visualize the frequency of amino acids in the translated protein sequence.
## Dotplot Analysis
- Upload Two DNA Sequences: Upload two DNA sequences in FASTA format for comparative analysis.
- Dotplot Generation: Create a dot plot to compare the similarity between the two DNA sequences. You can adjust the display limit to control the number of nucleotides shown.
# About Us
This web application was created by [Your Name] and [Your Collaborator's Name]. We are passionate about bioinformatics and genomics, and we developed this tool to make DNA sequence analysis and comparison more accessible.

# How to Use
Select "DNA sequence Analysis" or "Dotplot Analysis" from the menu on the left.
For DNA sequence analysis, upload a FASTA file, explore sequence details, and perform various operations.
For dotplot analysis, upload two FASTA files and generate dot plots to compare DNA sequences.
Feel free to explore and analyze DNA sequences using our web application!
